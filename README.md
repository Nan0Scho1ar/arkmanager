Originally based on [this example](https://github.com/zupzup/rust-commandline-example/blob/main/LICENSE) rust project by github user zupzup, though almost none of that code remains.
(The original license used in the example permits relicenseing and it was not filled out correctly, so this file has been omitted in exchange for an explicit acknowledgement of contribution in this README.)
